**ASSIGNMENT-1 COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS**

Done by :Blesson Issac and Michael Bimal

1. Suppose that you have only have access to a routine that produces samples U from the Uniform[0, 1]
distribution. Most packages used for statistical computing, such as R or MATLAB have access
to such a routine.

(a) Write a program that uses the inversion method to sample from a Binomial(10, 1/3) distribution.
Run the program and plot a histogram of 1000 samples. Recall that here you will
need to make use of the pseudo-inverse of the cumulative distribution function.

# Function For CDF from the PMF
def binomial_cdf(n, p):
    pmf_vals = [binomial_pmf(n, p, k) for k in range(n+1)]
    cdf_val = np.cumsum(pmf_vals)
    return cdf_val

cdf_vals = binomial_cdf(n, p)

# Function to sample from the Binomial(n, p) distribution using the inversion method
def sample_from_binomial(n, p, cdf_vals):
    u = np.random.uniform(0, 1)  # gives a uniform random variable between 0 and 1
    for k, cdf_val in enumerate(cdf_vals):
        if u < cdf_val:
            return k  # Return the binomial sample

"""The inversion method is used for sampling from a probability distribution using uniformly distributed random numbers. This method relies on the principle that if you have a uniform random variable
U distributed over
[0,1], then the variable X=F
−1
 (U) will have a distribution function
F, where
F is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the desired distribution.

(b) Now, using what you know about Binomial distributions, write a program that uses a combination
of the inversion and transformation methods to sample from the same Binomial(10, 1/3)
distribution. Run the program and plot a histogram of 1, 000 samples.
For this part, your answer should include a short proof of the correctness of your approach
as well as the program itself.

"""(c) We know that the expectation of a Binomial(10, 1/3) distribution is exactly 10/3. However,
let’s pretend that we don’t know its true value and want to estimate it using elementary
Monte Carlo integration.
Use 100 samples generated with one of the methods above to estimate the expectation
of a Binomial(10, 1/3) distribution and provide the standard error of the estimate and
approximate confidence bounds as per the Central Limit Theorem. You should briefly
restate the theory behind this approximation before applying it: simply putting the answer
with confidence bounds will not earn full marks.

"""2) Write a program that draws samples of Poisson(t) random variables using Uniform[0, 1] variables
as input. Use the transformation method to do so.
Hint: recall that if Xi are i.i.d. Exponential(1) random variables and Sn =
Pn
i=1 Xi, then
P(Sn ≤ t ≤ Sn+1) = e−t tn
n! . You may use this result without proof.
Run the program with t = 1 and plot a histogram of 1000 samples. Use 10, 100, 1000 and 10000
samples to estimate the mean of the Poisson(1) distribution and provide the standard error and
associated confidence bounds on the estimate for each case.

"""3. Finally, let us consider rejection sampling. We saw in class that rejection sampling is a generalpurpose
sampling method that needs to be used judiciously in order to make it work efficiently.
A poorly chosen proposal distribution will result in a high rejection rate.

(a) Suppose we have a mixture of a N(1, 0.5) and a N(2, 0.1) distribution with weights α1 = 0.2
and α2 = 0.8. Use a rejection sampling method to draw from this mixture with a single
normal distribution as a proposal. Choose the best parameters for this distribution (with
some justification why you have done so). What is the acceptance rate of your rejection
sampler? As a sanity check, you can try implementing the composition method to check if
you are getting the right answer.
